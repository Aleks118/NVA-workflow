No problems just a minor change in directories needed to make sure that git remote add upstream, everything works so far as per the instructions.

No big issues, just had to create a new folder to add the fork into (same name conflict)

nancydocode
No issues

Comment: There was some confusion on whether we should be creating pull requests yet or not. According to the instruction, it seems that it wants us to update the upstream repository directly (maintainer's job) and thus that was what was done (Changed the readme, committed, and pushed directly to the upstream repository from maitainer's local copy of the upstream repository).

No problems encountered with creating issues, straightforward.
